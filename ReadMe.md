# Spanish Tutor

This is a simple terminal based game to practice a fixed set of Spanish verbs. I decided to create this while traveling in Chile to visit my girlfriend and help me study along the way. 

My plan is to extend this further with some options including:

- Verbs, select options of:
    - AR
    - IR
    - ER
    - Reflexive
    - Conjugations (past, present, future)
- Nouns:
    - The home
    - Professions
    - Locations & Landmarks
    - Nationalities
    - Anatomy
    - Animals
    - Plants
    - Colors 
- Adjectives:
    - Personality
    - Moods/State
    - Physical Descriptions:
        - Height
        - Hair Color
        - Beauty
        - Skin Tone 

### Requirements

- Python version 3.8^
- [Translator Ubuntu package](https://github.com/soimort/translate-shell)

### Running the Program

Simply clone the repo and run the command:

```bash
$ python3 start.py
```

From there, you can enter your name & the desired amount of practice questions.
